# Attractors

### Generate, visualise, and explore strange attractor visually

This repository is a work in progress, and will contain Rust code to:

- generate strange attractors of various kinds, 
- visualise those attractors, 
- save images of the attractors,
- create videos of the attractors, as one or more parameters vary,
- and to 'explore' the parameter space of the attractor
